# Bridged

An IoT app for house sharing applications. An app will connect with an existing IoT systems and provide unified user interface for controlling appliances connected to the system. We also want to build a feature with checking out procedure which provides tenants with information about eg opened windows or lights that are still turned on. We want to accomplish that by placing some sensors in windows, doors etc. The "before checking out list' will be updated when tenant turn off the light or close the window. This feature will help not only hosts but also tenants. Hosts will be provided with information about state of rented flat live and tenants won't forget about anything before leaving the place. We believe that our app will save hassle for both sides and improve house sharing experience.
